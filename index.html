            Greetings! I'm Joaquin Cuenca, and I'm currently a third-year Computer Science student at Mabini Colleges. Allow me to give you a glimpse into my academic journey and who I am as a student and individual.
            Academic Journey I embarked on my computer science adventure at Mabini Colleges with a passion for problem-solving and a deep curiosity about technology's inner workings.
            Over the past three years, I've gained a solid foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, and data structures.
            My courework has covered a wide range of topics, from algorithms and software development to database management and artificial intelligence.
            I have consistently maintained a strong academic record and actively seek opportunities to apply classroom knowledge to real-world challenges.
